Time
====

Time is measured in seconds and dates are given in the J2000 date scale. This
corresponds to the number of seconds since 2000-01-01T12:00:00 TT (Terrestrial
Time), or 2000-01-01T11:59:27.816 TAI, or 2000-01-01T11:58:55.816 UTC.

Note that Unix Time is **not** the number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00
because it skips leap seconds.
